# Evaluate and print the result of the following expression
# x = 10 + 3 * 2**2
# Based on what you learnt in the lecture explain why the output is what it is


x = 10 + 3 * 2**2
print(x) # 22 

# 10 + 3 * 4 ----> pow have higer priority then + and *
# 10 + 12 ----> * have higher priority then +
# 22
